WHAT IS TYPESCRIPT :-

TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft.

It is a superset of JavaScript â†’ meaning every valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript.

It adds static typing (you can define the type of variables, functions, objects, etc.).

It helps catch errors at compile time instead of runtime.

It makes code more predictable, maintainable, and scalable, especially in large projects.

TypeScript code is not directly run by the browser; it is compiled into JavaScript first.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:
JavaScript = dynamic (no type checking)
TypeScript = JavaScript + type checking + extra features

Would you like me to also explain the advantages of using TypeScript over JavaScript?
