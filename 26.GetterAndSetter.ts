/*

✅ What are Getter and Setter?

Getter → a special method used to read the value of a property.
Setter → a special method used to update the value of a property.
They are part of encapsulation → instead of exposing properties directly, you control how they are accessed or modified.
With getters and setters, you can add extra logic like validation, formatting, or calculations.
